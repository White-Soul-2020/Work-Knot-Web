## Team Workknot

1. [Ankit Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankit-kumar-44488a191/)
   Founder & Marketing head

   The seeds of Workknot were sown the day my friend Dayasheel and I had a substantive discussion on the difficulty faced by the workers for finding work and the customers who have to undergo a complex process for finding a well-suited worker for their need. These issues ultimately made us think of providing the customers and the workers with a paramount and concrete platform for easily connecting for their respective requirements. Being the leader of the team, I take major policy decisions and manage this project on the ground level by meeting the concerned people from several domains so that we can do the best of Workknot and the interaction of customers with well-suited workers can become easy. Thus, I provide my team a full- fledged support system. I am also the roots of the control system behind the market management implementations and all the decision makings. The Authorised database of workers and customers is created by me to bridge the gap between them and hence providing the best of the Services from Workknot.

2. [Nishant Mishra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nishant-mishra-16b76b1a4/)
   Co-founder & Web developer

   I always showed interest in projects, especially regarding Web Development. So, when Ankit proposed this idea, I agreed without hesitation. I tried my best to rectify the loopholes in this plan, so that we could come up with the best platform for our customers. I have gained knowledge in languages like html, Java script and python. My job is to focus on the webpage and upgrade it regularly.

3. [Hardik Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hardikkr/)
   Technical head & App developer

   I was passionate about learning User interfaces and  Application development when I joined the college because  it fascinated me the most. When Ankit and Nishant  approached with this great platform, I was swayed by  the idea of establishing a platform which was indeed  a rostrum for all kinds of workers. Hence,  I made up my mind to join the team where  I am responsible for the management of  the technical implementation of Workknot. I  designed the frontend and backend of Workknot  and made an application which can run both on Android and iOS.  I believe once launched WorkKnot is going to reach heights.

4. [Harshit Ruwali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harshitruwali/)
   Technical support & AI developer

   I joined Workknot when the team was facing some hardships. After joining, I immediately started modifying and upgrading the algorithm. I also added Artificial Intelligence to this platform to make it more user friendly. My aim is to come up with the best platform for our customers to indulge in.

5. Dayasheel
   Innovator & Legal helper

   “The creation of something new is not accomplished by  the intellect but by the play instinct acting from inner necessity”,  these words of Carl Jung indeed go true behind the story of  establishing Workknot. The daily fret of hiring workers for the  construction of my home made me and my friend Ankit to think about a  solution that can make this complex process easy. Another major  reason which drove us to work further was our encounter with many  impoverished workers who went back home without a penny in hand  due to the lack of communication with the customers.  As “Necessity is the mother of invention”, I suggested  Ankit to form a team which could work for the solution to  this issue and thus the foundation of Workknot was laid.  I lead the team with the scintillating rays  of innovation and handle the legal matters that come across.

6. Anjana Haridas
   Content writer & Speaker

   My passion for oratory evoked at a very small age, and ever since I've tried to refurbish it. I joined the team late, but trust me, the enthusiasm was quite high. I am the voice of this platform and it is my duty to convey the message of Workknot loud and clear.

7. [Avani Mishra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avani-mishra-b85282190/)
   Marketing strategist & Content creator

   In the team, I am the helping hand of Ankit in managing the platform on the technical level. Besides this, my job mainly focuses on the Research and Development for creating a wellspring of all the needed information to the Workknot team. I am also one of the content writers in the team so that the correct information can be disseminated to our customers in an expeditious way. As I have been studying Data Analysis for a while hence, it helps me scrutinize the market strategies of team Workknot. I also analyze and study the data collected at ground level so that the correct information about the ongoing market strategies and development could be delivered to my team

8. [Ashi Sachan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashi-sachan-58801b182/)
   Graphic designer
   
   I joined Workknot a few days prior to it's release. “Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you”, these words from Oprah Winfrey have always being guiding to me as I am very passionate about art. This paved my way for becoming a graphic designer in the team and here my job is to increase the visual appeal of the platform.

## About Workknot

Workknot, as a platform, originated through a simple idea followed by a well scrutinized plan. This idea, which aims at connecting skilled as well as unskilled workers with the customers through an online medium, came out when Ankit (Founder & Marketing Head) and his friend Dayasheel (Innovator & Legal Helper) were on a phone call.

In India, the Labour Force Participation Rate is just 49.80% (source: [Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)](https://thewire.in/labour/periodic-labour-force-survey-data-employment)). We found that the lack of proper communication between the workers and the customers is one of the main causes behind this low rate. After a lot of research, we came to know that a Workknot-like platform existed in foreign land but is unimplemented in our country. So, Ankit wanted to create such an online platform and hence he took help for layout and website development from his friend, Nishant, who is an outstanding Web Developer. After the layout was planned, we consulted some Chartered Accountants, Lawyers and Business Consultants to know more about the sustainability of this idea. And to our surprise, they were flabbergasted after listening it. Their great response motivated us to plan further.

Then the time came when we started connecting the dots and so, we gave the technical responsibility to a talented budding programmer and one of the hardest working members of our team, Hardik, for the Workknot App development.

While the project was in its intermediate stage, we enthusiastically welcomed our new member, Anjana, to give a magical touch to the descriptive & preliminary aspects of our project with her beautiful oratory & scription skills. During the creation of the platform, we faced some technical difficulties which were won over by Harshit (AI Developer). He helped us by modifying some algorithms and he also made Workknot more user-friendly by adding Artificial Intelligence. Then we felt that we needed someone to analyse lots of data which could help us to improve Workknot further. So, we greeted Avani into our team. She is a research enthusiast and a superb content creator. She also helps the team through her marketing management skills. Finally, we welcomed Ashi. There's no word to describe her artistry. She almost fills life in lifeless things through a variety of artistic skills. She fulfilled all of our design-related requirements and also created the Logo of Workknot.

Workknot is an online platform which will be initially implemented on a small scale. It facilitates the customers and the workers to connect at the ease of their fingertips. The facilities provided under Workknot get enhanced once the users sign up for their individual profiles on Workknot. As most of the workers we come across are not so familiar with this technology, so at the beginning, we will fill their details on our own. We have tried our best to keep this platform in close proximity to the contractors, civil engineers, labourers, masons, technicians and people in similar fields.

For Team Workknot, revenue or source generation does not hold any priority right now. Our main aim is to make Workknot a valuable social asset and to give a powerful support to the Indian workforce through establishing a good customer-worker connection. However, we may need some financial resources to support this kind act. So, we may use advertisements or other healthy ways to support ourselves as well as Workknot.

As a future plan, we have also decided that we may provide some valuable support (like healthcare facilities, insurance, etc.) to the necessitous workers connecting to Workknot. Though all such plans depend on the success of this small step of Workknot, we are hopeful for the best.
