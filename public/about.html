        We, Team WorkKnot, believe that everyone should get
        fair share in the society. We have seen that it is
        very difficult to get in touch with labourers for
        temporary services so, here We are with this platform
        which helps you to get directly in contact with these
        labourers for your domestic requirements. This App follows
        three simple steps i.e checking the availability of workers,
        booking them for specific time and finally, payment. One
        tap on the booking button, and we ensure that you have the
        premium services.

                The seeds of Workknot were sown the day my friend Dayasheel and I had a substantive discussion on the difficulty faced by the workers for finding work and the customers who have to undergo a complex process for finding a well-suited worker for their need. These issues made us think of providing the customers and the workers with a concrete platform for easily connecting for their respective requirements. Being the leader, I take major policy decisions and manage this project on the ground level by meeting the concerned people from several domains. Thus, I provide my team a full- fledged support system. The Authorised database of workers and customers is created by me to bridge the gap between them and hence providing the best of the Services from Workknot.

                 I am an Undergraduate student, currently pursuing Computer Science in VIT , Bhopal. I always showed

                specially regarding Web Development So, when Ankit proposed this idea , I agreed without hesitation . I
                tried my best to

                I was passionate about learning User interfaces and  Application development when I joined the college because  it fascinated me the most. When Ankit and Nishant  approached with this great platform, I was swayed by  the idea of establishing a platform which was indeed  a rostrum for all kinds of workers. Hence,  I made up my mind to join the team where  I am responsible for the management of  the technical implementation of Workknot. I  designed the frontend and backend of Workknot  and made an application which can run both on Android and iOS.  I believe once launched WorkKnot is going to reach heights.

               Hi, I am an student of VIT, Bhopal, getting my degree of Technology in Computer Science. I joined Oblique when the team
               was facing some hardships with the algorithms. After joining, I immediately started modifying and upgrading the algorithm. I also added Artificial Intelligence to this platform to make it user friendly. And solely worked on the backend of the web-page, which is usually the most important and toughest in Web-Development. 
               My aim is to come up with the best platform for our customers to indulge in.

               The daily fret of hiring workers for the  construction of my home made me and my friend Ankit to think about a  solution that can make this complex process easy. Another major  reason which drove us to work further was our encounter with many  impoverished workers who went back home without a penny in hand  due to the lack of communication with the customers.  As “Necessity is the mother of invention”, I suggested  Ankit to form a team which could work for the solution to  this issue and thus the foundation of Workknot was laid.  I lead the team with the scintillating rays  of innovation and handle the legal matters that come across.

              I have been brought up in a way to keep my eyes on stars and feet on the ground due to which I developed a sound knowledge regarding the ground level reality of the problems faced by workers and also the customers. Hence I support the team by providing relevant data of skilled and unskilled workers. Like thin individual strands spiraled together to braid a strong rope,I also contact and deal with the Contractors and the Dealers  so that We at Workknot can bridge the gap between the workers and the hardships they face in finding a suitable work for them.

              In the team, I am the helping hand of Ankit in managing the platform on the technical level. Besides this, my job mainly focuses on the Research and Development for creating a wellspring of all the needed information to the Workknot team. I am also one of the content writers in the team so that the correct information can be disseminated to our customers in an expeditious way. As I have been studying Data Analysis for a while hence, it helps me scrutinize the market strategies of team Workknot. I also analyze and study the data collected at ground level so that the correct information about the ongoing market strategies and development could be delivered to my team
